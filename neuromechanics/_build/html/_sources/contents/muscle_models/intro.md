# Muscles - The Biological Motors

Muscles are the motors of bodies. They are internal actuators, capable of generating forces and motion through their interaction with our bodies and the external environment. In fact, if we ponder it more closely, we may realize that muscles are our ONLY[^1] way of interacting with the external environment. Walking, talking, moving objects, sign language, writing a letter, typing an email, completing an exam, and any other activity that connects to the world outside our bodies requires the contraction of muscles.

In this section, we will:
* examine the physiological and mechanical characteristics of muscles
* build a simple mathematical model of a muscle called a Hill-type muscle model

[^1]: Technically, we could consider sweating an interaction with the external environment, but beyond raising the local humidity a miniscule amount, you need muscles.
